Please go through every class in this solution, answering all questions as you go along.

Questions are asked in code comments at the top of every class, outlining the scenarios that we would like you to cover.

You are permitted to add any references from nuget or any other code sources that you see fit. Answers may add classes, methods, 
properties or any other code that you as a candidate feel necessary.

There are multiple ways of answering the vast majority of these questions, your code will be read through at the end and evaluated against 
how you went about answering these questions just as much as whether the code would do what the question asks.

You are permitted to use google, or any other internet resource you see fit in this answer. However this should be used as a reference for things that you have forgotten about, instead 
of learning new technology. If you do not understand a question, there will not be a penalty for skipping it.
As an example of this, please do not google 'What is demeters law' or 'what are the solid principles'
